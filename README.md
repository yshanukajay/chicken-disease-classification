# 🐔 Chicken Disease Classification – End-to-End MLOps Project

This project implements a complete MLOps pipeline for detecting chicken diseases using deep learning and modern software engineering practices. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, orchestrated through DVC, and structured following industry-level MLOps principles, it demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained, tracked, deployed, and monitored in a scalable, reproducible workflow.
